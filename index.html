        <p>Welcome to my Zine! If you’re a college student looking to take someone on that date you probably won’t have that cash to head to a Broadway show or hit the bar for something that may not amount to anything at all. And even if you did, you shouldn’t. Unless your rich, in that case fork it over! Here you'll find some good places to start with for whatever is within your comfort zone.</p>

      <h2 class="articletitle">You want to keep it simple.</h2>
      <section =class="articletext">
        <p>Free comedy nights like St. Mark’s and The Knitting Club’s are always nice. If you’re willing to spend some more you'll have the option too as they have everything from ramen to shark steak at St. Marks.</p>

        <section =class="articletext">
          <p>The High Line is clean, has a great view, and is perfect at nearly any time of the day. At night there are usually stargazing activities that you can join in and there are a ton of snacks along the path like gelato, lattes and ice cream. Nothing though beats the Bagel and Coffee Company that is just a little walk away and right next to the station you’d probably use to get there. They put all other bagels and brunch places to shame with a wide selection of contents from smoked salmon with avocado, fruits and veggies with honey sauce to something as place as cream cheese and toasted. Chelsea Market has some of the best brownies you’ll ever taste and goat milk ice cream which you and your date has likely never tried before. But for me, nothing has beaten the casual but serene setting Bubby’s, Clinton East, and Mom’s Kitchen and Bar. Unlike the other places for dates though, this one may be tougher simply because there’s nothing to comment on. But for me it works, and that’s the most important part of picking from these choices, finding the one that you’re comfortable with. (Warning: Bubby’s pancakes could sink an iceberg)</p>

        <section =class="articletext">
          <p>The Botanical Gardens give you and your date something to comment on, if your not so great with making conversation this will probably be your thing. Maybe study up on flowers beforehand too, if you really want to impress. The food in the botanical gardens is mediocre, but outside are some decent places to grab a snack like tacos or sandwiches, which really fit the whole “flowery stroll thing” anyways.</p>
